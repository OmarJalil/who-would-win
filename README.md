# Who Would Win Bot ðŸ¥Š

A [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/WhoWouldWinBot) that posts polls so that people can decide which of two random emoji would win in a fight.

Twitter doesn't allow most apps to create poll cards, so we have to pretend we're tweeting from Twitter for iPhone. Some more details about that are available [in the source code](https://github.com/daneden/who-would-win/blob/master/index.js#L6-L31).
